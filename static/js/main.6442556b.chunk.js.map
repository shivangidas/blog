This environment has an option to register for Service workers\n            which led me to find out what they were to begin with. Service\n            worker is a script that moderates between your app, the browser and\n            the network. This allows one to cache resources and use them instead\n            of making multiple requests to fetch every time. However, its most\n            fascinating application is when the internet is not there at all.\n            Normally, we come across the T-rex, Downasaur (yes, that is its\n            name). Since there is a service worker in between the browser and\n            the internet cosily caching all the resources you asked for, it goes\n            ahead and serves them. And your site runs offline!\n          </p>\n          <hr />\n          <h3>Initial frustration</h3>\n          <p>\n            All was good, till I discovered new additions to my site were not\n            showing up at all. Worked in incognito mode{\" \"}\n            <code>(CTRL + SHIFT + N)</code> only. Turns out once a service\n            worker is registered, it keeps serving the cached pages till all\n            instances (tabs) of the website/app are closed. Not refreshed,\n            closed! <br />\n            From the docs, I came across the fact the if there was a change in\n            the serviceWorker.js file, it would tell the browser about the new\n            service worker and allow fetching the resources again. However, when\n            the new service worker is registered, the old one continues to work\n            and is only replaced on closing and reopening the page. <br />\n            There are ways to let the users know about this.

I had 4-5\n            job offers, and I chose this company mostly because the people in my\n            interview talked about books. To understand my fascination with\n            reading, I can trace back the luck factor to my childhood. My\n            grandfather had a personal library and I was excited by the idea of\n            owning so many books. I was in an I.C.S.E. school where reading was\n            encouraged. My relatives owned bookstores, which meant I had easy\n            access to books from a young age in a town with very few libraries.\n            In fact the libraries that did exist were far and didn’t stock\n            contemporary or children’s books. In my relatives' bookstores I was\n            allowed to read any book and return them if I didn’t break the spine\n            :D\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            I got into sci-fi fast and ended-up reading a lot of Asimov on\n            recommendation from my computer teacher. I had a latent interest in\n            AI because of that which bloomed when I joined AllGoVision. I could\n            see for the first time actual use of AI. My mentor there encouraged\n            me to learn about it even though my job was web development. My\n            sister was then in academics and she suggested that I look into\n            scholarship opportunities abroad.{\" \"}\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            I had applied to the University of Bristol through the Chevening\n            Scholarship but didn’t get it. The University suggested I apply for\n            the British Council scholarship for women in STEM which I did\n            receive. I came to Bristol and through the British Council was\n            offered to enrol into a mentorship program. Covid hit and pretty\n            much all chances of securing a job evaporated. I came to know about\n            civil services through another girl in the mentorship program. I\n            applied for different roles and was offered the position of Software\n            Engineer in DWP digital, Newcastle.

We should consider the whole body; our interactions\n            with our environment make us up. We are not only our mind. I drew\n            the insight that since this was the thinking it seeped into AI too.\n            The things we consider intelligent like playing chess is what we\n            tried to train the machines to do. But wouldn’t you rather have a\n            robot taking out your garbage? That’s not considered intelligent and\n            hence wasn’t the first things we wanted to try with AI.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Sometime later I came across this article in Guardian by Josh\n            Wilbur:\n            <strong>\n              <a\n                href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/nov/26/life-on-the-inside-as-a-locked-in-patient-jake-haendel-leukoencephalopathy?mc_cid=429d7e1486&mc_eid=3a522e62a6\"\n                target=\"_blank\"\n                rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n              >\n                'Is anybody in there?'
