This environment has an option to register for Service workers\n            which led me to find out what they were to begin with. Service\n            worker is a script that moderates between your app, the browser and\n            the network. This allows one to cache resources and use them instead\n            of making multiple requests to fetch every time. However, its most\n            fascinating application is when the internet is not there at all.\n            Normally, we come across the T-rex, Downasaur (yes, that is its\n            name). Since there is a service worker in between the browser and\n            the internet cosily caching all the resources you asked for, it goes\n            ahead and serves them. And your site runs offline!\n          </p>\n          <hr />\n          <h3>Initial frustration</h3>\n          <p>\n            All was good, till I discovered new additions to my site were not\n            showing up at all. Worked in incognito mode{\" \"}\n            <code>(CTRL + SHIFT + N)</code> only. Turns out once a service\n            worker is registered, it keeps serving the cached pages till all\n            instances (tabs) of the website/app are closed. Not refreshed,\n            closed! <br />\n            From the docs, I came across the fact the if there was a change in\n            the serviceWorker.js file, it would tell the browser about the new\n            service worker and allow fetching the resources again. However, when\n            the new service worker is registered, the old one continues to work\n            and is only replaced on closing and reopening the page. <br />\n            There are ways to let the users know about this.

I had 4-5\n            job offers, and I chose this company mostly because the people in my\n            interview talked about books. To understand my fascination with\n            reading, I can trace back the luck factor to my childhood. My\n            grandfather had a personal library and I was excited by the idea of\n            owning so many books. I was in an I.C.S.E. school where reading was\n            encouraged. My relatives owned bookstores, which meant I had easy\n            access to books from a young age in a town with very few libraries.\n            In fact the libraries that did exist were far and didn’t stock\n            contemporary or children’s books. In my relatives' bookstores I was\n            allowed to read any book and return them if I didn’t break the spine\n            :D\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            I got into sci-fi fast and ended-up reading a lot of Asimov on\n            recommendation from my computer teacher. I had a latent interest in\n            AI because of that which bloomed when I joined AllGoVision. I could\n            see for the first time actual use of AI. My mentor there encouraged\n            me to learn about it even though my job was web development. My\n            sister was then in academics and she suggested that I look into\n            scholarship opportunities abroad.{\" \"}\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            I had applied to the University of Bristol through the Chevening\n            Scholarship but didn’t get it.

I came to Bristol and through the British Council was\n            offered to enrol into a mentorship program. Covid hit and pretty\n            much all chances of securing a job evaporated. I came to know about\n            civil services through another girl in the mentorship program.

I drew\n            the insight that since this was the thinking it seeped into AI too.\n            The things we consider intelligent like playing chess is what we\n            tried to train the machines to do. But wouldn’t you rather have a\n            robot taking out your garbage? That’s not considered intelligent and\n            hence wasn’t the first things we wanted to try with AI.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Sometime later I came across this article in Guardian by Josh\n            Wilbur:\n            <strong>\n              <a\n                href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/nov/26/life-on-the-inside-as-a-locked-in-patient-jake-haendel-leukoencephalopathy?mc_cid=429d7e1486&mc_eid=3a522e62a6\"\n                target=\"_blank\"\n                rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n              >\n                'Is anybody in there?'

Explored a\n            wonderful second hand bookshop, Barter Books, in Alnwick,\n            Northumberland. I explored the Shamble's market on a day trip to\n            York; so much awesome food.

By the way, this change has been sooooo good, I have come across some amazing, relatable, and extremely well written characters. Plus the stories just make sense.

I like to call my list the brag list.\n          </p>\n          <h3>Your range</h3>\n          <p>There are various tips and tricks to negotiation but the best thing you can begin with is getting information and deciding some numbers. This is something that has worked for me.</p>\n          <p>You need to come up with 3 numbers. These numbers are just for you, do not tell this to any recruiters or managers. We call them: </p>\n          <ul>\n            <li>Walk-away offer</li>\n            <li>Happy offer</li>\n            <li>Hell yes offer</li>\n          </ul>\n          <p>\n            Walk-away offer: the minimum that you want or need, whichever is higher. If you are into making budgets or at least have a rough idea about your expenditures, this number is all that plus more so you can get started towards achieving your goals.\n            I call this the walk away offer - anything less than this and we walk because it is not enough to build any real wealth.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Happy offer: the offer you actually want, this is the what the best in the industry, that is people like you, should be making. This is the number where you can achieve your goals faster. I call it the Happy number or offer.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Hell yes offer: come up with an insane ridiculously high offer, that you think is unachievable. Why? Because we often limit our own worth. Imposter syndrome anyone? This number should help make it easy for you to negotiate when you’re offered something more than your happy number and you want to say 'Hell Yess!'. Because you must always negotiate. There are no exceptions.\n          </p>\n          <p>I have purposefully not added any example numbers here, you need to research and come up with these based on your circumstances and the kind of responsibilities you handle at work.\n          </p>\n          <h3>Prepare your script</h3>\n          <p>One of the rules of negotiation is to never to be the first one to give the salary expectation and never disclose your current salary. You, however, do need to ask for the budget the company has for that role. You have prepared your range, you know where it falls and should be ready to talk accordingly. </p>\n          <p>Since talking about money is unnecessarily difficult, make sure to have a script prepared. Here's some examples of what I would say in different situations. I learned this from Alison Taffel Rabinowitz in her salary negotiation masterclass\n            <a href=\"https://www.thefinishingschool.co/\"\n              target=\"_blank\"\n              rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> 'Get your money honey'</a>.\n      Alison works with women, coaching them to get paid more.\n          </p>\n          <Image\n            src={scripts}\n            alt=\"Negotiation scripts\"\n            caption=\"Scripts for different scenarios\"\n            width=\"100%\"\n            height=\"auto\"\n          />\n          <p>It always helps to have multiple offers at the same time. You can and should also use your current position as a leverage when moving to a different company. This blog <a href=\"https://haseebq.com/my-ten-rules-for-negotiating-a-job-offer/\"\n            target=\"_blank\"\n            rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> My ten rules for negotiating a job offer by Haseeb Qureshi </a> is packed with very detailed tips on negotiation.</p>\n          <p><strong>In any conversation, remember to be kind, optimistic and honest.</strong></p>\n\n          <h3>There's more on the table</h3>\n          <p>Some companies would have a set list of perks they give their employees. Which is great but since we have a list of priorities we know at this point which perks would make more sense to us and we should 100% ask to discuss that. These come directly from what you value most. I would focus on more paid time-off, working remotely, and training budget plus leadership training.\n            </p>\n          <Image\n            src={perks}\n            alt=\"List of perks other than pay\"\n            caption=\"Take your pick\"\n            width=\"100%\"\n            height=\"auto\"\n          />\n          <p>A lot of this depends on company policy and sometimes you may get a 'no we can’t do that'. However it’s always worth asking. Sometimes things that mean a lot to you may be something the company hasn’t considered yet and is willing to provide. If nothing this at least starts the conversations around these perks so companies know what employees value today, for example the 4-day work week trials happening in the UK.
