          <p>
            What a week has it been! I was freaking out for part of it because
            things I needed were taking time (two weeks delay!). Lesson learnt:{" "}
            <i>Donâ€™t assume anything. Get dirty, ask, enquire, confront.</i> It
            is especially important to remind myself of this since I am
            inherently an introvert. It helps tremendously that I am now
            consuming content with the intent of producing. This practice makes
            me calm, knowing I am going to learn something new. I read so many
            things this week that it has been hard to choose the best of it.

            , or rather picking multiple careers depending on the changing times
            and you. It was an excellent exercise on self-reflection and I feel
            like I am learning a lot about my own thinking process.

              <i>Building a second brain</i>{" "}
            </a>
          </strong>{" "}
          podcast by Tiago Forte. I listen to him on my walks and come home with
          new ideas or confirmation of my own ideas (exciting when that
          happens). Highly recommend trying it out. He has some interesting
          views on capturing ideas and building a reservoir of resources called
          the Second Brain.

            I am also listening to Steely Dan because John Mulaney, a
            comedian/actor/writer I like, likes Steely Dan :D

          <h3>Book I enjoyed</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Doctors by Erich Segal</strong>
            <br /> Segal of the Love Story fame, provides a glimpse into the
            lives of medical students, researchers and doctors. I thoroughly
            enjoyed reading it.

            <br /> I am sad I didn't come across this sooner. A biography of
            Claude Shannon, the man who suggested bits (0s and 1s) could be used
            to store information.

            especially the evil ones.
